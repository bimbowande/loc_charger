    <p>Create a Coverage Overview tool</p>
    <p>
      Purpose: Create a dynamic “Coverage Overview” map that allows the user to
      view the parts of the UK that are covered by the installers in our
      network. The user should also be able to select any combination of
      chargers, installers, or areas (postcode and range combinations) to narrow
      down the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can't build the project or run into any issues where you cannot
      continue please reach out to me by email before wasting hours and I'll
      help you along.
